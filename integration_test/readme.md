integration test:

sometimes its possible in our project our system be connected to outside for sending or recieving data.
for example reading or passing data to database for programmer or client.
for awaring of correct performance of modules which do this connections, we should write ingration test.
in unit test we have not to use this issue.

so when we want to  test a module by task to communicate to outside world, we need integration test , the functionality that we expect is communicating to out... for example commiunicating to db or paymentgateway or any third party service.
