unit test :
this type of test, tests the little units in our program like function, class or object ...
by passing this test, we will be aware of correct action in each unnit of our program.

In this type of testing process, we check the behavior of the function, what outputs we will get with the types of inputs.

in uint test when we make some changes in our units, then run the test we wil be aware of this point that the cahnges could make differance for our units or not.
we normaly face by failed pass in this usecases.

there is a convention named table test , when we need test a list of inputs we can use it.
